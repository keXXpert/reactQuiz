Simple Quiz Single Page Application (SPA) on React.js
The app uses Redux, redux-thunk middleware, axios requests and auth on Firebase, react-router for navigation, creates cookies for auth session, provides custom forms validation (without redux-form and formik), etc.
Intentionally made without class components (using Hooks).
